<p> This semester I am currently attending Astronomy. I chose the class mainly for a filler class, but I've always wanted to know about celestial objects in the universe.
<p> I chose my professor since he taught my Physics class previously. I liked his way of teaching since he does not take attendance, and the class consisted of weekly online quizzes and 3 in-class tests.
<p> Although I received a D the first time I took the Physics course, I took the class again and earned a B. He actually changed the course to include more in-class activities which were pretty fun. So Astronomy is one of my favorite classes
